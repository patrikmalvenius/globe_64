* fpseventhandler seems to lose reference to scene when entered/exited but button still active in app bar. find out if it is so, and why, then fix
* better mobile ui - give layer control minwidth, put tool buttons in popdown
* Entity in pickelevationhandler: add nice marker for click position, clean up entity + label when unloading tool
* click on 3d-model: add custom html table, better positioned
* search bar: don't move app title when opened. make target entity nice looking. clean up target entity
* fps view: add "walkmode" with keyboard. collisions??
* drag drop mixin: add and test funcitonality
* mixin init: move out of wmslayers. find/create good spot to load
* camera on app load: find out how to place it in nice position without flyto
* flyto-button: larger padding, add change cursor on hover so it's the same like for the rest of the mui components. tooltip that does it??
